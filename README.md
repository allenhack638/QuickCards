# QuickCards - Secure Card Management Android App

QuickCards is a secure, local-first Android application that allows users to safely store, manage, and quickly access their credit/debit card details with robust biometric security and a clean, intuitive user interface.

## Features

### 🔒 Security

- **AES-256 GCM Encryption**: All sensitive card data encrypted at rest
- **Local Storage Only**: No cloud sync, all data stays on your device
- **Auto-lock**: Automatic app locking after inactivity
- **CVV Protection**: CVV hidden by default, requires authentication to view
- **Screenshot Prevention**: App prevents screenshots for security

### 📱 User Interface

- **Two-Tab Navigation**: Clean bottom navigation between Cards and Settings
- **Material Design 3**: Modern, consistent UI following Material Design guidelines
- **Search Functionality**: Search cards by number, bank, tags, or description
- **Card Management**: Add, edit, delete, and view card details
- **Tag System**: Organize cards with customizable tags
- **Copy Functionality**: One-tap copying of card numbers and expiry dates

### 🛠 Technical Features

- **System Card Scanning**: Integration with Android's built-in card scanning capabilities
- **Room Database**: Local SQLite database with encryption
- **MVVM Architecture**: Clean architecture with ViewModels and LiveData
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern Android UI toolkit
- **Kotlin**: 100% Kotlin codebase

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Platform**: Android (API 26+)
- **Architecture**: MVVM with Jetpack Compose
- **Database**: Room with SQLCipher encryption
- **Authentication**: Android BiometricPrompt API
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose with Material Design 3

```

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Android SDK API 26 or higher
- Device with biometric authentication (recommended)

### Build Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd QuickCards
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**:

   - Open Android Studio
   - Select "Open an existing Android Studio project"
   - Navigate to the QuickCards directory and select it

3. **Sync dependencies**:

   - Android Studio will automatically sync Gradle dependencies
   - If not, click "Sync Now" in the notification bar

4. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

5. **Run on device/emulator**:
   - Connect an Android device with USB debugging enabled, or start an emulator
   - Click the "Run" button in Android Studio or use:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

### Dependencies

```

## Security Features

### Data Encryption

- All sensitive card data (number, expiry, CVV) is encrypted using AES-256 GCM
- Encryption keys are stored in Android Keystore for hardware-backed security
- Database files are not backed up or synchronized

### Authentication

- App requires biometric authentication on launch
- CVV viewing requires separate authentication
- Auto-lock after 30 seconds of inactivity (configurable)
- App locks when backgrounded and returns to foreground

### Privacy

- No network permissions - app works entirely offline
- Screenshots and screen recording blocked
- App excluded from recent apps preview
- No cloud backup or data extraction allowed

## Usage

### Adding Cards

1. Tap the "+" button on the Cards tab
2. Use "Scan Card" to automatically detect card number and expiry
3. Manually enter CVV (never auto-detected for security)
4. Select bank from dropdown list
5. Add tags and description as needed

### Viewing Card Details

1. Tap any card from the list
2. View masked card information
3. Copy card number or expiry date with one tap
4. Authenticate to view CVV (auto-hides after 10 seconds)

### Managing Data

1. Go to Settings tab
2. Manage banks and tags for better organization
3. View app statistics and security information
4. Clear all data (requires authentication)

## Contributing

This is a security-focused application. When contributing:

1. Follow Android security best practices
2. Ensure all sensitive data remains encrypted
3. Test biometric authentication thoroughly
4. Validate that no data leaks through logs or unencrypted storage
5. Maintain the offline-first approach

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Security Notes**:

- This app stores financial information - security is paramount
- All sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- Biometric authentication is required for sensitive operations
- App works entirely offline - no data is transmitted

## Troubleshooting

### Biometric Authentication Issues

If you encounter "caller provided 4 no permitted" error during export or other operations:

**Error Code 4 (ERROR_LOCKOUT)**: This occurs when biometric authentication is temporarily locked due to too many failed attempts.

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait and retry**: The lockout is temporary and will automatically clear
2. **Use device lock**: The app will automatically offer device lock (PIN, pattern, password) as a fallback
3. **Check biometric settings**: Ensure your fingerprint/face recognition is properly configured
4. **Restart device**: In rare cases, a device restart may resolve persistent lockout issues

**Prevention:**

- Ensure your finger/face is clean and dry when using biometric authentication
- Position your finger/face correctly on the sensor
- Avoid rapid repeated attempts

### Export/Import Issues

- **File format**: Export files use the `.qcex` extension and are encrypted
- **Compatibility**: Import only files exported from this app
- **Authentication**: Export requires biometric or device lock authentication
- **Storage**: Ensure sufficient storage space for export files

### General Issues

- **App crashes**: Restart the app and try again
- **Data not saving**: Check if you have sufficient storage space
- **Authentication not working**: Verify biometric settings in device Settings
